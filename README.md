### Algorithmic Trading
Automation of technical analysis and trading operations
Managing a trading account using special applications in MetaTrader 5 is called algorithmic or automated trading. Such applications are called trading robots and can independently analyze quotes of financial instruments, as well as perform trading operations in the forex or stock market. Thus, robots are able to completely replace a trader when working on financial markets.

All components of algorithmic trading in MetaTrader 5 are combined into a specialized development environment (MQL5 IDE, Integrated Development Environment). It covers the entire cycle of working with trading applications and allows you to independently create, debug, test, optimize and execute trading robots.

In MetaTrader 5, you can not only write EAs yourself, but also download, rent or buy thousands of ready-made applications for free. If this does not seem enough to you, you can always order the development of your own robot from experienced programmers.
